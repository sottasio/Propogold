# Propogold
Software for using statistics and combinations for the gambling game Propogoal in Greece.
# Motivation
This piece of software was built after my friend's wish to have an opportunity to bet with the maximum of possibilities to win.
Even if it is not a popular game, I hope that some people may find it useful.
# Technology used
This software was built with Java SE 7, Swing and Eclipse as an IDE.
# Running this software
In order to run this software, Java must be installed on your computer. You are going to need and some libraries as jar files to put in this project. These are the following:

- 'miglayout-3.7'  For the components easier layout.
- 'opencsv-3.8' For reading and writing csv files.
- 'jsoup-1.7.2' For parsing html files.
- 'json-simple-1.1.1' For handling json files.

You are also going to need some .jpg files (already uploaded as a folder named Images) that are displayed in Swing form.

Main class is 'gui.java'.

Because of the fact that this softwares writes and reads from disc, a maximum space of about 200mb is needed.

# Use of this software
A seperate help file is included to make the first steps in using this software.
